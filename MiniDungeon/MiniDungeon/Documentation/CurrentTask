- IMPLEMENT SAVE FEATURE 💾

NOTES:
- I already can make GameState as class but without @Model macro
- I also was able to make Tile as class @Model with EventType and TileType being conformed to Codable Protocol
- As result i was able to see changes on the dungeonMap when i explore it but very clanky. I was able to rerender different tiles but because GameState wasn't persistant entirely flags like "isExplored" or "isHeroPosition" weren't rerender correctly

- Making a class as @Model already makes it's observable so it will track it changes and it will save it's updates automatically

- GoogleAI mode can be useful for such research

- Try to find examples of integration SwiftData with MVVM architecture

Plan:
- Send an entire version to git hub to preserve my current state of the game and get it back if SwiftData update fail
- Try to make all types in GameState to conform or to Codable or to @Model macro so the whole GameState can be marked as @Model
