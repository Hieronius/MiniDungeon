- BUG 03.02.26 - if you use flask damage on the target during animation from the combo and if enemy dies after that, you will get double loot again ✅
- Remove flask from DungeonView and probably pin into Combat View. If you ask Danil to test where it belongs more it's mean it's a final stage of the game which is not true' ✅

- Check Shrines/Talants you didn't implement but user still able to see/click/upgrade ✅
- If you have "ItemToDisplay != nil" before user dies you can see it's info and equip it in next run. Check all related properties and erase them each run ✅ (set itemToDisplay to nil in all navigation methods of inventory and merchant view)

28.01

- Rename buttons "Unleash flask defensively" to "Gain extra EP/energy" and so on accordingly to current impact collected ✅
- Change an animation of HIT button in Combat View to mimic an original button behaviour because the current one is a little bit stupid ✅

27.01.
- When you deal damage like 13-15 you get 25-30 flask combat impact which is not correct ✅
- strange spell power bonus without equiped items) ✅
- Change the way combat mini game works - only first tap should be detected, not pressing until you stop ✅
