1. Implement condition to upgrade shrines in order accordingly to it's rarity. It's mean you can't upgrade legendary ones before common, rare and epic ones being upgraded

2.. Create a method to go back to previous screen you went from:
- if you select map from menu -> menu should appear in navigation block
- if you press "hero stats" from dungeon map, "dungeon" should appear in navigation
and so on

3. Adjust enemy hp/damage/defence to be a little bit easier

4. Adjust Gold/Exp/Energy reward generation system accordingly to current level of the dungeon

5. Implement one unique ability for each class:
- block for knight
- fireball for mage
- heal for priest
- 100% critical attack for assasin
- Double Strike for Warrior
and so on


6. I need localisation if i want folks to test it
