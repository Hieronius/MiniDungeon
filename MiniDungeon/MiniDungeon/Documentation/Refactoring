FILE HAS BEEN INSPECTED 16.11.25

- RorateButtons and CheckButtons methods in ChestLockPickingView can be made into one

1. Файл Utility
В методе endHeroTurn можно добавить в ветку else для if gameState.isHeroTurn и перенести использование enemyTurn() туда. И убрать проверку if !gameState.isHeroTurn из метода - Tried to do it but something went wrong and enemy turn won't start


- If the blue line in mini game reached the end of the screen you should get - "failed" result

- Inventory Armor/Weapons slots should be as a buttons so user can inspect what he already wear

- Refactor an entire Potion System because using a switch with potion Labels is not quite good

- May be should implement NavigationBar

- In MerchantView you should also add categories for items like Weapons/Armors/Potions and so on. Because when you get 10+ items it's already hard to distinguish what is what

- Implement info about what level you get in LevelBonusView

- Implement LootScheme as struct where you can define what kind of loot will be droped. So when you encounter an enemy/shrine/chest you simply pass it's scheme to generateLoot(_ lootScheme) to generate an exactly this type of loot without manually repeating all methods like "generateGold" and so on

- ItemProtocol is to redundant data type to handle in SwiftUI and SwiftData combination, think about getting rid of it. Too complicated on this stage
