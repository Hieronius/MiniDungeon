Project should be rogue like to avoid complexity in development

Each run should start from scratch and each run should add some points for the hero or environment which will affect all other runs.

Such as minor flat improvements of starting gold, sword, armor, health, mana or stats

Implement little pieces of story on the paper pages you can receive randomly when you slain an enemy or solve the puzzle

Each action like a crit attack/tile explored/dialogue should get you some score points. After the run you should convert this score to some kind of money and exchange for skills or talants

Instead of getting experience for each fight, suggest to upgrade something on user choice like hp, mana, attack after each battle win. Each 3 battles give a special talant or perk. After each 6-9 wins another one.
