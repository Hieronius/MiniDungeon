1.1. Add all hero's stats as a bonuses to Armor/Weapon so you can create different items

2. Add Armor with hp/mana/energy bonus

3. Implement the same generation system for Armors/Bubbles/Potions as we did with Weapons

4. Test and fix Weapon/loot generation (in a single fight i did collect common, rare and legendary weapon - is it a result i want to achieve or only one item per type should be allowed in loot generation?)

3. If the blue line in mini game reached the end of the screen you should get - "failed" result

4. When all romes of the dungeon has been cleared there should be the mark or something like that to notice the user to press "go to next level" button

5. Inventory Armor/Weapons slots should be as a buttons so user can inspect what he already wear
